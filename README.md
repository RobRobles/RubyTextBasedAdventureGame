RubyTextBasedAdventureGame
==========================

This is a simple ruby text based adventure game. You compile the game.rb file to start the game. There are different locations 
and items that you can interact with. This game was a small project I was working on. You can expand on this, you can have a 
different story line, as well as different objectives for completing the game.
